# Automotive-Price-Prediction-Engine
The "Automotive Price Prediction Engine" is an advanced data science project designed to develop a robust model for predicting the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of cars based on various features
The project encompasses several key tasks, including data cleaning, handling outliers, feature encoding, and building a multiple linear regression model. The predictive model is evaluated using essential metrics such as R2 Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


# The project's main objectives include:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handling missing values by dropping or imputing as necessary.
Identifying and removing duplicate entries from the dataset.

Outlier Handling:
Detecting and addressing outliers in the MSRP column to enhance model performance.

Feature Encoding:
Utilizing one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables like Make, Type, Origin, and DriveTrain into numerical format for model compatibility.

Multiple Linear Regression Modeling:
Building a predictive model using multiple linear regression to establish a relationship between car features and MSRP.

Performance Evaluation:
Assessing the model's performance using key metrics such as R2 Score, MAE, and RMSE.
Providing detailed insights into the model's ability to explain variance and make accurate price predictions.

Learning Curve Analysis:
Visualizing the learning curve to understand how the model's performance evolves with increasing training data.
Result Interpretation:

Interpreting and explaining the R2 Score, MAE, and RMSE values to convey the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed price prediction model.
The "Automotive Price Prediction Engine" empowers stakeholders in the automotive industry with a reliable tool to estimate car prices based on essential characteristics, facilitating better decision-making and market analysis.
